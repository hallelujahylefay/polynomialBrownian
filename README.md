# A polynomial decomposition of Brownian motion (Corollary 4.1.4, Theorem 4.1.6, Theorem 4.1.9, Theorem 4.1.10 from Foster. 2020)
Let $W$ be a standard Brownian motion on $[0, 1]$. We have
$$W^n = W_1 e_0 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}I_k e_k$$

where $e_0(t) := t$ and the random variables $\{I_k\}$ are independant of $W_1$.

For $1\leq k\leq n-1$, 
$$I_k = \int_0^1 (W_t-W_1e_0(t))\frac{e_k(t)}{t(1-t)}\mathrm{d}t$$

where $e_k(t) = 1/k \sqrt{k(k+1)(2k+1)}P_{k+1}(2t-1)$.

For each $n\geq 2$, we have
$$k(k+2)P_{k+2}(X) = (k+1)(2k+1)XP_{k+1}(X)-k(k+1)P_k(X)$$

# Inhomogeneous Geometric Brownian Motion
Consider the following Stratonovich SDE:

$$\mathrm{d}y_t = a(b-y_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sigma y_t\circ\mathrm{d}W_t$$

It is known that it admits a unique strong solution satisfying:

$$y_t = e^{-ah+\sigma W_{s,t}}(y_s+ab\int_s^t e^{a(u-s)-\sigma W_{s,u}}\mathrm{d}u)$$

The Parabola-ODE method gives

$$
Y_0 := y_0$$

$$
Y_{k+1} = e^{-ah+\sigma W_{s,t}}(y_s+ab\int_{t_k}^{t_{k+1}} e^{a(s-t_k)-\sigma \tilde{W}_{t_k,s}}\mathrm{d}s)
$$
